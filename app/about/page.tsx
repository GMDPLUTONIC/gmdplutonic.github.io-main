				<p className="mt-4 about pb-16">I first started coding in early 2024. C++ had peaked my interest, and I started following tutorials. Soon, I was making simple code for all sorts of things, ranging from small works to currently in the making geode mods. I kept making small things until I found Github in the same month and it was a LIFE CHANGER. As soon as I saw what github had to offer, I saw other people working on their own site. This inspired me to make my own site in HTML and CSS.
				<br /><br />
				Soon after, I followed a course which taught me the fundamentals of websites. After this, it only received minor updates every now and then. Later, I wanted to try making a Discord bot (still in development). Because I already knew how to, I decided to make it in JavaScript. This bot progressed me far further than any other prior coding project. For the next few days, I would use something called botghost to create private Discord bots for my servers.
				<br /><br />
				In early August (which is when im making this right now), I decided to finally update my website, which was severely outdated. However, instead of using HTML and CSS, like I did for my original one, I decided to create it in NextJS. This allowed me to customize it beyond anything I could have imagined.
